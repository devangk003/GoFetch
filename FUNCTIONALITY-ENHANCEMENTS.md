# Website Functionality Enhancement

## Overview

This update focused on ensuring the DataInsight platform is fully functional by connecting all API endpoints and enhancing error handling. The changes improve the robustness of the application and ensure that all components work correctly with the backend API.

## Completed Enhancements

### API Connectivity

1. **Improved API Service Layer**
   - Enhanced error handling and response processing
   - Added detailed error logging for easier debugging
   - Standardized response handling across all API functions
   - Added fallback mechanisms for handling incomplete data

2. **Proxy Configuration**
   - Updated Vite config to properly route API requests
   - Ensured consistent API base URL usage across the application

3. **CORS Settings**
   - Updated backend CORS configuration to accept requests from all frontend ports
   - Added wildcard support for development environments

### Data Handling

1. **Enhanced Coordinates Mapping**
   - Expanded NYC neighborhood database with 60+ locations
   - Improved matching algorithm with case-insensitive comparison
   - Added proper error handling for invalid locations
   - Implemented normalization of location names

2. **Data Transformation**
   - Standardized data field access across different API response formats
   - Added type conversion for numeric fields
   - Implemented fallback values for missing data
   - Added date formatting helper function

### Component Improvements

1. **MapView Component**
   - Added robust error handling for map initialization
   - Improved marker creation with validation of coordinates
   - Enhanced popup content with more detailed information
   - Added better error messages for different failure scenarios

2. **TrendsView & PredictionsView**
   - Both components now properly handle various data formats from the API
   - Added consistent data field mapping
   - Enhanced error handling and loading states

## Testing

The application has been tested with various scenarios:

1. **API Connectivity Tests**
   - Verified all endpoints return expected data
   - Confirmed error handling works as expected
   - Tested fallback mechanisms

2. **Component Tests**
   - Verified map displays correctly with different data sources
   - Confirmed search functionality works with the NLP endpoint
   - Tested trends and predictions with various cities and date ranges

## Next Steps

While the application is now fully functional, further enhancements could include:

1. Comprehensive unit and integration tests
2. Performance optimization for larger datasets
3. Additional visualizations for trends and predictions
4. Enhanced filter capabilities for the map view
