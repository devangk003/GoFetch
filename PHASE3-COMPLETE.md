## Next Steps

While Phase 3 is complete, there are a few areas that could be enhanced in future phases:

1. Implement more comprehensive unit and integration tests
2. Add more advanced filtering options for the map view
3. Enhance the prediction algorithm with more data sources
4. Add user authentication for personalized dashboards
5. Implement data export functionality

## Conclusion

The completion of Phase 3 marks a significant milestone in the development of the DataInsight platform. The frontend now has a solid foundation with React Query for data fetching, robust error and loading states, and a smooth user experience across all components. The final integration of the search bar into the navigation bar completes the UI improvements, creating a more professional and cohesive user interface.
