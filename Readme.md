## üéØ Problem Statement

Public datasets hold immense potential to inform decisions and drive change, but they are often underutilized due to:
- Complex data analysis tools requiring technical expertise
- Lack of intuitive interfaces for non-experts
- Limited leverage of AI and advanced search technologies
- Barriers for users without data science backgrounds

## üí° Solution

DataInsight bridges this gap by providing:
- **Natural Language Querying**: Ask questions in plain English‚Äîno coding required
- **Real-Time Insights**: Always see the latest data and trends
- **AI Predictive Analytics**: Get forecasts and recommendations to inform decisions
- **Vector Search**: Uncover hidden patterns using MongoDB's advanced capabilities

## üöÄ MVP: Air Quality Monitoring

Our MVP focuses on India's air quality dataset from data.gov.in to address pressing public health concerns.
